## Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R: Using phylogeny as a statistical fix

## Aims
To learn how to use R to answer phylogenetic comparative questions (without panicking!). By the end of this problem set you should be able to:

1. Read in your data and phylogeny
2. Match taxa in your phylogeny with those in your dataset
3. View and manipulate your phylogeny
4. Calculate measures of phylogenetic signal (Î» and K) using geiger and picante
5. Perform PGLS analyses using caper
6. Perform a phylogenetic ANOVA using geiger

We will be using the evolution of primate life-history variables as an example, these data come from the PanTHERIA database (Jones et al. 2009) and 10kTrees.

Note that many things in R can be done in multiple ways. You should choose the methods you feel most comfortable with, and do not panic if someone is doing the same analyses as you in a different way! This workshop will be full of different ways to do things.
